## Covid-19 detection from chest x-ray images

Building a classification model with Keras that differentiates between covid-19, Pneumonia, and the normal case from chest x-ray images

This Example consists of 

- Dataset description
- Train test split
- Image processing with Keras ImageDataGenerator
- Building a CNN model and visualizing it's architecture
- Model training and performance assessment (metrics, classification report, confusion matrix, training and validation curves visualization)
- Visualization of the confusion matrix
