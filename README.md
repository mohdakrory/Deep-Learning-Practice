## Automobile mile per gallon prediction

Building an MLP regression model with keras to predict mile per gallon for given features of an automobile 

This Example consists of 

- Dataset description (source, variable description, samples, total no. of samples)
- Exploratory data analysis (duplicates, missing values, datatypes, visualizations, correlation, pandas profile report)
- Feature Encoding
- Feature scaling with MinMaxScaler
- Train-Test split
- Creating an MLP regression network and visualizing its architecture 
- Model training and performance assessment (MSE, MAE, R2)
- Making predictions on a new sample
