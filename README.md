# Deep-Learning-Practice
This repository comprises illustrative examples showcasing the application of deep learning algorithms across various datasets to address diverse tasks.

## Brain tumor detection from MRI images 

Building a classification model with Keras that differentiates between Meningioma, Glioma, Pituitary, and the normal case from MRI images

This Example consists of 

- Dataset description (samples, class distribution, total no. of samples, train-test split)
- Image processing with Keras ImageDataGenerator
- Building a CNN model and visualizing it's architecture
- Model training and performance assessment
- classification metrics, classification report, confusion matrix, training and validation curves visualization, visualization of the confusion matrix
- Making predictions on a new image 

## Covid-19 detection from chest x-ray images

Building a classification model with Keras that differentiates between covid-19, Pneumonia, and the normal case from chest x-ray images

This Example consists of 

- Dataset description (samples, class distribution, total no. of samples)
- Train test split
- Image processing with Keras ImageDataGenerator
- Building a CNN model based on the VGG-19 pre-trained layers and architecture visualizing 
- Model training and performance assessment
- classification metrics, classification report, confusion matrix, training and validation curves visualization, visualization of the confusion matrix
- - Making predictions on a new image
